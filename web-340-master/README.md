## Course Description

This course introduces the process of building web-based applications in Node.js with Express.  Students learn to create web forms, collect and process information obtained from them, retrieve and update information contained in a MongoDB database, and build stand-alone RESTFul API's.  GitHub is used to host and share coding projects.  

Prerequisite: N/A

## Repository Overview 

Carefully read the assigned chapters, videos, and narrative I've included under each exercise and assignment.  

Most exercises and assignments have runnable sample code so you can visually see the concept "in action."  Assignments are broken into "milestones" and each "milestone" builds on the last.  

Approach every week from top-to-bottom and do not move to the next assignment/exercise without fully understanding the previous.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buwebdev/web-340.git
cd web-340
```

Setting up and running the examples:
```bash
cd [week]/[folder]
npm install 
npm start | npm run dev | node index.js
```
